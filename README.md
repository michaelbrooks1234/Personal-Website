# Personal-Website
A Django website that I made to give some brief info on myself and show off my projects in a new format. The website was made in with Python and the Django framework. All the styling on the website was made using css. I deployed the website using a Linux VPS with the Ubuntu 18.04 LTS os. The website is hosted with an apache2 server.

The html is in django_project/home/templates/home
The css and images used are in django_project/home/static/home

Some of the code is slightly outdated due to changes made in the linux bash terminal.
